# inverted_index
In this project, a sample input text file consisting of Doc IDs and sentences is given. Based on this provided input text file, the task is to build an inverted index using the information extracted from the given data. The index is stored as a Linked List in memory, as the examples shown in textbook (Refer An Introduction to Information Retrieval by Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan, Hinrich Schütze - Chapter 1 – Boolean Retrieval). Having built this index, we implement a Document-at-a-time (DAAT) strategy to return Boolean query results. Finally, we calculate the TF_IDF score to rank and sort the query results.
